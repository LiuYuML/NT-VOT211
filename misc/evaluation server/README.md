## Transform your raw results into .json file
We've provided a `converter.py` script to assist you in converting your raw results into a `.json` file. To use it, simply run the following command:

```bash
python converter.py
```
Before executing the script, ensure that you have correctly set the variables on lines 4, 5, and 6.
