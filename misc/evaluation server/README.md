## (IMPORTANT) choose your phase and submit

To maintain a clean and readable `Leaderboard` for everyone, we strongly encourage the challengers to submit their .json file in private phase. So that you can try different hyper-parameter setting. And only submit the most competitive results on our `Leaderboard`. For the public phase, challengers are also asked to fill the device(GPU) they use and the url of the corresponding publication, this is aimed to hlep the possible citation of your method. For the pbulic phase, if you want your evaluation on `Leaderboard`ï¼Œ please check "Baseline" in `My Submissions`
