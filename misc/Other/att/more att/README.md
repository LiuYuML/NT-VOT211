To run the `attribute-wise drawing.py` script we provided, simply place it in the same folder as the JSON files. The only configuration required is the `result_plot_path` on the first line, which specifies the storage location for the output images.

Additionally, to provide more attribution plots, we have also included JSON files for attribution evaluations of other methods. You can find these files in the [more att](https://github.com/LiuYuML/NT-VOT211/tree/main/misc/Other/att/more%20att) directory.
