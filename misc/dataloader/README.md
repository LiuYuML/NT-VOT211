# Tutorial for evaluation script
## add the necessary files
If you are using the official [pytracking](https://github.com/visionml/pytracking/tree/master) framework, please add the provided `nt_vot_211dataset.py` file to the `.../.../evaluation` directory. For those using an adapted version of the pytracking framework, such as [ARTrack](https://github.com/MIV-XJTU/ARTrack), the file should be placed in the `pytracking/evaluation` directory. Alternatively, for official pytracking framework, the path should be `lib/test/evaluation`.
